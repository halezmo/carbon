  designerNotes: `
* An eye catching visual indicator used to help a user visually scan and identify items with something in common from a wider list.
* A range of colours and visual styles is available.
* Pills could work particularly well in Tables, for example, to distinguish which invoices are overdue in a long list, or which subscriptions a client has, or to indicate that a feature has ‘beta’ status.
