# Creating an App in Rails

## Introduction

In this guide, we will walk through building a [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/) driven [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) view within a Rails application.

We assume that you already have a Rails application, and are looking to add React views to it using Carbon.

## Setup

Before you begin, ensure you have followed the first time setup guide for [Carbon Factory](https://github.com/Sage/carbon-factory/blob/master/docs/first-time-installation.md).

### Create a project

To begin, navigate to the root directory of our Rails application:

```
cd ~/development/my-rails-app
```

Then lets use the Carbon command line interface to scaffold a new Carbon project:

```
carbon app myproject
```

This creates the directory `myproject` within our Rails application, with everything we need to start building our React components.

### Configure and run gulp

As we work, we can set [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) to watch for file changes and to recompile our assets automatically. The Carbon command we previously ran setup gulp for us with some default options, but we will want to update those options specifically for our Rails application.

In order for Rails' asset pipeline to pick up the JavaScript compiled by our gulp task, we will want to specify the destination for our compiled JavaScript and CSS files. To do this, edit the `gulpfile.js` in our projects root directory:

```javascript
// ./myproject/gulpfile.js
var gulp = require('gulp');
var BuildTask = require('carbon-factory/lib/gulp/build');
var SpecTask = require('carbon-factory/lib/gulp/spec');

var opts = {
  jsDest: './../app/assets/javascripts',
  cssDest: './../app/assets/stylesheets',
  fontDest: './../public/assets/fonts'
};

gulp.task('default', BuildTask(opts));
gulp.task('test', SpecTask());
```

In this example we have provided additional options to the `BuildTask`, telling it to output the CSS and JS into the appropriate `/app/assets` directories of our Rails application where the asset pipeline can find them. We have also told it to output fonts into the `/public/assets` directory.

We can now run gulp to compile our assets and watch for any file changes from the root directory of our project:

```
gulp
```

### Rails layout

To render the components in our Rails application, we need to create a new Rails layout with the following criteria:

* The Carbon prepare task creates `ui.js` and `ui.css` and we need to include these in the layout.
* We need to insert a HTML `<div>` with an ID of `app` - this is where our view will be rendered.
* We should assign the data passed down by the Rails server to a JavaScript variable in the layout called `APPDATA`.

For example:

```html
<!-- ./app/views/layouts/carbon.html.erb -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- including the stylesheet generated by the gulp task -->
    <%= stylesheet_link_tag "ui" %>
  </head>

  <body>
    <!-- HTML div to render our React components -->
    <div id='app'></div>

    <!-- assigning data from an instance variable called @data to the javascript variable APPDATA -->
    <script type="text/javascript">
      window.APPDATA = JSON.parse('<%= @data.to_json.html_safe %>');
    </script>

    <!-- including the javascript file generated by the gulp task -->
    <%= javascript_include_tag "ui" %>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Rails controller/action

To render the new layout, we need to tell the Rails controller action to use it.

For this example, we want to render the layout when users call the `index` action of the welcome controller.

Simply add `layout: 'carbon'` to the call to render:

```ruby
# welcome_controller.rb

def index
  # for the data we will pretend we have a model called Foo, and we want to use the first entry of Foo
  @data = Foo.first
  # we will render the index view, with the carbon layout we created
  render :index, layout: 'carbon'
end
```

We are not interested in yielding any markup from Rails here, so make sure your `index.html.erb` for this controller's view is empty.

### Creating your first view

In React, everything is a component. When we talk about views, we're using an abstraction - we really mean a component built up from several modular components (i.e. widgets). 

To create a view (or any other component), create a class representing that view:

```javascript
// ui/src/views/journals/reverse/index.js

import JournalStore from 'stores/journals';
import React from 'react';
import { connect } from 'carbon/lib/utils/flux';

class JournalsReverse extends React.Component {

  render() {
    return (

    )
  }
};

export default connect(JournalsReverse, JournalStore);
```

We import a view helper as a Flux utility from Carbon and use the connect function to connect the component to the store.

Suppose you want a `Form` containing:

* a `Textbox` 
* a `Date`
* an `InputGrid` (formerly TableFieldsForMany) containing 2 `Textbox` fields

You need to import each component you want to use into your view:

```javascript
// ui/src/views/journals/reverse/index.js

import JournalStore from 'stores/journals';
import React from 'react';
import { connect } from 'carbon/lib/utils/flux';

import Form from 'carbon/lib/components/form';
import Textbox from 'carbon/lib/components/textbox';
import Date from 'carbon/lib/components/date';
import InputGrid from 'carbon/lib/components/input-grid';

class JournalsReverse extends React.Component {

  render() {
    return (
    )
  }
};

export default connect(JournalsReverse, JournalStore);
```

Once you have imported the components into your view, you can add them to the `return` block using [JSX](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html) syntax as follows:

```javascript
// ui/src/views/journals/reverse/index.js

// ...import statements

class JournalsReverse extends React.Component {

  render() {
    /* Here we're defining what children components InputGrid will 
    render. We can pack these children components into an array. 
    InputGrid is a complex component that renders components 
    passed to it as children. */

    var inputGridFields = [<Textbox />,<Textbox />];

    return (
      <div>
        <Form>
          <Textbox />
          <Date />
          <InputGrid />
        </Form >
      </div>
    )
  }
};

export default connect(JournalsReverse, JournalStore);
```

Notice that we enclose everything in a `<div>` tag. That's because React expects the return block to return a single component. (We don't actually need the `<div>` here since our `<Form>` is a single component but we include the `<div>` as best practice).

### Setting up our Store

A [Store in React](https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/overview.html#stores) holds all of the information about the current state of our view. At the moment, our view is static and can't be updated. 

For our Rails app, the Store will also hold data fetched from the database, which it will then pass down to the components.

```javascript
// ui/src/stores/journals/index.js

import Store from 'carbon/lib/utils/flux/store';
import Dispatcher from 'dispatcher';
import ImmutableHelper from 'carbon/lib/utils/helpers/immutable';

class JournalStore extends Store {

  constructor(Dispatcher) {
    super(Dispatcher);

    // this is required for the store to work (it should be a unique name)
    this.name = 'journalStore';

    // here we assign the parsed JSON data from our app
    this.data = ImmutableHelper.parseJSON(APPDATA.journal);
  }
}

export default new JournalStore(Dispatcher);

```

### Updating our View with props

The connected store data is available to our View's `state` object using the unique name defined in the store's contructor. For example:

```js
this.state.journalStore.get('date')
```

Carbon components also use React [`props`](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/transferring-props.html) allowing you to pass data down to a component. 

Our components have a few required props which we'll add now.

```javascript
// ui/src/views/journals/reverse/index.js

// ...previous import statements
import JournalActions from 'actions/journal';

class JournalsReverse extends React.Component {

  render() {
    var inputGridFields = [<Textbox key='1' name='service' />,
                           <Textbox key='2' name='description' />];

    return (
      <div>
        <Form model='journal' action='/journals' method='post'>
          <Textbox
           name="description"
           value={ this.state.journalStore.get('description') }
           onChange={ JournalActions.journalValueUpdated } />

          <Date
           name='date'
           value={ this.state.journalStore.get('date') }
           onChange={ JournalActions.journalValueUpdated } />

          <InputGrid
           name='journal_lines'
           data={ this.state.journalStore.get('journal_lines') }
           deleteRowHandler={ JournalActions.deleteJournalLineRow }
           addRowHandler={ JournalActions.updateJournalLineRow }
           fields={ inputGridFields } />
        </Form>
      </div>
    )
  }
};

export default connect(JournalsReverse, JournalStore);
```

Note that we have imported a new module called `JournalActions`. This defines the actions used by the `InputGrid` component and onChange actions. We haven't created any actions yet, let's do that now.

### Creating Actions for your view

Actions are essentially objects we use to pass data through our view. Read more about them [here](https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/actions-and-the-dispatcher.html#content).

#### Defining our actions as constants

You should define all of your actions in a constants file.

Having the action names clearly visible in one file gives a good high level view of the available actions making it easier to spot errors or duplication as well as making it more obvious what the application is used for.

For example:

```javascript
// ui/src/constants/journals/index.js

export default {
  JOURNAL_VALUE_UPDATED:   'journalValueUpdated',
  DELETE_JOURNAL_LINE_ROW: 'deleteJournalLineRow',
  UPDATE_JOURNAL_LINE_ROW: 'updateJournalLineRow'
}
```

You can pass any data you want inside an action - the only requirement is to define an actionType which is used to register the action with our Store.

For example:

```javascript
//ui/src/actions/journal/index.js

import Dispatcher from 'dispatcher';
import Constants from 'constants/journals';

var JournalActions = {

  journalValueUpdated: (ev, props) => {
    Dispatcher.dispatch({
      actionType: Constants.JOURNAL_VALUE_UPDATED,
      value: ev.target.value,
      name: props.name
    });
  },

  deleteJournalLineRow: (ev, props) => {
    Dispatcher.dispatch({
      actionType: Constants.DELETE_JOURNAL_LINE_ROW,
      row_id: props.row_id
    });
  },

  updateJournalLineRow: (ev, props) => {
    Dispatcher.dispatch({
      actionType: Constants.UPDATE_JOURNAL_LINE_ROW,
      row_id: props.row_id,
      name: props.name,
      value: ev.target.value
    });
  }
};

export default JournalActions;
```

Now we need to update our Store to listen for these actions:

```javascript
// ui/src/stores/journals/index.js

import Store from 'carbon/lib/utils/flux/store';
import Dispatcher from 'dispatcher';
import ImmutableHelper from 'carbon/lib/utils/helpers/immutable';
import Constants from 'constants/journals';

class JournalStore extends Store {

  constructor(Dispatcher) {
    super(Dispatcher);

    this.name = 'journalStore';

    this.data = ImmutableHelper.parseJSON(APPDATA.journal);
  }

  [Constants.JOURNAL_VALUE_UPDATED](action) {
    this.data = this.data.set(action.name, action.value);
  }

  [Constants.DELETE_JOURNAL_LINE_ROW](action) {
    this.data = ImmutableHelper.deleteLineItem(
      [this.data, 'journal_lines', action.row_id]
    );
  }

  [Constants.UPDATE_JOURNAL_LINE_ROW](action) {
    this.data = ImmutableHelper.updateLineItem(
      [this.data, 'journal_lines', action.row_id, action.name], action.value
    );
  }
}

export default new JournalStore(Dispatcher);

```

Our Store is now listening for the defined actions - any time they are called in our view, the store will update the view. [Read more here](https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/overview.html#structure-and-data-flow)

### Setting up React routes

Carbon uses [React Router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router) to bind view components to specific paths. Before we can see anything on our page, we need to specify the route:

```javascript
//ui/src/main.js

import React from 'react';
import { Route } from 'react-router';
import { startRouter } from 'carbon/lib/utils/router';

import JournalsReverse from 'views/journals/reverse';

var routes = (
  <Route path="/journals/:id/reverse" component={ JournalsReverse } />
);

startRouter(routes);
```

Note that we've defined the path as the url, and the component to render as our view component.

You can now navigate to your view to see our rendered view.

If you don't see anything, check that gulp is running and that it isn't reporting any syntax errors. If gulp doesn't report any errors, you can check the Console to see if any errors are reported there.
